# Symbolia
Symbolia is a set of clean, consistent, and non-distracting symbolic icons for GNOME and other desktop environments. It is modeled after Google's Material Design and includes original icons as well as [ones provided by Google itself](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) and [ones made by the community](https://materialdesignicons.com/). Symbolia supports all the standard icons defined in the [freedesktop naming specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) as well as numerous other apps.

This includes _only_ symbolic icons. It is best used on top of or in conjunction with another non-symbolic icon theme for maximum aesthetic.

## Symbolia in Action

Symbolia can be used with any theme, but [Materia](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme) is recommended. The non-symbolic icons in the following screenshots are from [Yaru](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru).

## Supported Programs

Officially, Symbolia is only guaranteed to be maintained for GNOME and the standard freedesktop icons. However, symbolic UI icons have also been added for the following programs. Note that application icons for many more programs are also included.

- Epiphany
- Tilix
- Evince
- Fractal
- Inkscape
- Setzer
- GNOME Maps
- Geary
- Kalzium
- GNOME Weather
- Xournal++
- Icon Library
- Transmission (partial)
- Pitivi
- Gnumeric

There are also several programs that are not yet supported but have support planned.

- GIMP

Eventually, it'd be nice to be able to support Breeze and KDE programs as well.
