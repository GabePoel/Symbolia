Symbolia

Symbolia is a set of clean, consistent, and non-distracting symbolic icons for GNOME and other desktop environments. It is modeled after Google's Material Design and includes original icons as well as [ones provided by Google itself](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) and [ones made by the community](https://materialdesignicons.com/). Symbolia supports all the standard icons defined in the [freedesktop naming specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) as well as numerous other apps.

All icons included are in the symbolic style. But, there are both symbolic and non-symbolic versions of the icons included. That being said, it is best used on top of or in conjunction with another non-symbolic icon theme for maximum aesthetic.

## Installation

If you _just_ want to use Symbolia icons, you can run the `scripts/basic-install` and `scripts/basic-uninstall` scripts to install and uninstall respectively. Or just copy/paste the following line into your terminal.

```shell
cd ~/Downloads && git clone https://github.com/GabePoel/Symbolia.git && cd Symbolia/scripts && sh ./basic-install
```

Then just delete the Symbolia folder.

### Firefox Installation

Firefox requires custom CSS to overwrite the default icons. Luckily, that's provided. There's a basic installation script for Firefox as well. But, manual installation is recommended.

```shell
cd ~/Downloads && git clone https://github.com/GabePoel/Symbolia.git && cd Symbolia/scripts && sh ./firefox-install
```

## Symbolia in Action

Symbolia can be used with any theme, but [Materia](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme) is recommended. The non-symbolic icons in the following screenshots are from [Yaru](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru).
