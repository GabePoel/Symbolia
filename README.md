# Symbolia
Symbolia is a set of clean, consistent, and non-distracting symbolic icons for GNOME and other desktop environments. It is modeled after Google's Material Design and includes original icons as well as [ones provided by Google itself](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) and [ones made by the community](https://materialdesignicons.com/). Symbolia supports all the standard icons defined in the [freedesktop naming specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) as well as numerous other apps.

Symbolia includes _only_ symbolic icons. It is best used on top of or in conjunction with another non-symbolic icon theme for maximum aesthetic.
